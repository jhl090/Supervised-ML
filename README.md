# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This repository consists of a variety of classification algorithms implemented for different data sets and tasks:

• k-Nearest Neighbors - classifying gray scaled images of digits (natural numbers)

• Perceptron, Voted Perceptron, Average Perceptron, One v. All - classifying Internet post membership based on topic

• Kernalized Perceptron (String Kernel) - classifying protein family membership based on protein sequences

• Boosting - classifying spam emails based on distribution of words
